# Databases
Work carried out in order to complete assignments for the Database Systems module in second year computer science. The first task was to work in a group to design a database solution for a mock company, this involved carrying out a presentation identifying relationship types, the creation of a Dataflow Diagram &amp; Entity-Relational model, and carrying out normalisation. The next task was to independently implement the database solution using MySQL (both DDL and DML) and to write a report discussing the topics of NoSQL and Database Security.
